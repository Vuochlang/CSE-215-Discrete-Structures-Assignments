# PA1: Operation of sets

write a C program to operate on sets. Our universe of elements consists of all (normal, printable, non-whitespace) 
single characters that can be entered from the keyboard (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and punctuation).

_ Program will prompt the user for the elements of the first set (called A): the user enters the elements, followed by < ENTER >. 

_ Do the same for the second set (B)

_ Assume input lines are no more than 120 characters each

_ If the user enters an element twice, it only appear in the set once and ignore whitespace

_ The empty set is a valid set

_ Then the program will output back the following :
  
    _ Set A and Set B
    
    _ The cardinality of A and B
    
    _ A u B: A union B
    
    _ A ^ B: A intersect B
    
    _ A / B: elements belongs to A but doesn't belongs to B

# PA2:

write a program to test Goldbach's Conjecture: the conjecture that any even integer>4 can be written as the sum of two odd primes

_ The program will ask for a starting even number and how many (even) numbers to test and try to write out all the even numbers as the sum of two primes
